/****************Serial Port Communication between microcontroller and computer********************/

1)Reading the temperature information received from the LM35DZ Temperature Sensor with ADC and displaying it on the LCD screen.

2)Displaying the time information which entered from the computer on the LCD screen.

3)Observing the data read from the ADC both on the computer screen and on the LCD screen via the microprocessor through the
application developed with C# via UART communication. The clock information which entered from the application developed over C#
is transmitted to the microprocessor via the UART communication protocol and observed on the LCD screen.
